Results Summary
===============

This file will collect final metrics, model details and notes for result tables.

Current status
- Pipeline: dataset -> preprocessing -> RRFS -> class balancing -> CV training -> evaluation.
- Final model (KNN) was produced during earlier runs; a local model exists at `ProposedApproach/models/final_model.pkl`.
- APK feature extraction and prediction: a lightweight feature extraction was run and produced `ProposedApproach/apk_prediction.txt`.

Planned results to fill in
- Best tuned Random Forest parameters and CV metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC AUC).
- SHAP global and local explanation plots.
- Runtime (training & inference) and resource usage.
- Limitations, dataset biases, and ethical considerations.

To populate: run the RF tuning (see `scripts/run_rf_tuning.py`) and add plots/CSV outputs under `ProposedApproach/results/`.
