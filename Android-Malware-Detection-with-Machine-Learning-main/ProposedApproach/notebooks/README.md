# Notebooks for Android Malware Detection (ProposedApproach)

This folder contains three notebooks to explore and run the project interactively:

- `01_EDA.ipynb` — Exploratory Data Analysis: data preview, class distribution, missing values, correlations, sample export.
- `02_Training_Evaluation.ipynb` — Train/test pipeline: trains all implemented classifiers, shows confusion matrices and metrics. Includes a small hyperparameter tuning cell (RandomizedSearchCV with `n_iter=3`, `cv=2`) for quick experimentation.
- `03_Comparison_MLflow.ipynb` — Cross-validation and MLflow logging: runs 5-fold CV for each model and logs mean/std metrics to MLflow (local `mlruns` by default) and plots comparisons.

Quick start

1. Activate the project's venv from `ProposedApproach`:

```bash
. .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install Jupyter if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab
```

3. Start Jupyter Lab from the `ProposedApproach` folder:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

4. Open the notebooks and run cells from top to bottom. The EDA notebook can create a small sample (`Datasets/Drebin_v1_sample.csv`) for faster iteration.

Notes about hyperparameter tuning and speed

- To keep runs fast during interactive work, tuning in the notebooks uses small search sizes (`n_iter=3`) and small CV (`cv=2`). The main flow (`main.py`) was also updated to use `RandomizedSearchCV(n_iter=3, cv=2)` so it completes faster.

- For more thorough tuning, increase `n_iter` and `cv` in `MachineLearningModule/MachineLearningFlow.py` or in the notebook cells before running long experiments.

MLflow and DagsHub

- By default the code logs to local MLflow (`./mlruns`). If you prefer to log to DagsHub, configure DagsHub credentials and change tracking as needed.

If you want, I can run the modified `main.py` now and collect the final model and evaluation metrics.
