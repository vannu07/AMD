Project Planning & Prioritization
=================================

This document lists recommended next steps to make the project more robust and production-ready.

High priority (now)
- Pin environment and produce `environment.yml` or `requirements.txt` (already present).
- Add documentation: `AUTHORS.md`, `PROJECT_PLANNING.md`, `RESULTS.md` (this file).
- Focused RF tuning (RandomizedSearchCV n_iter=30, cv=3) — run and save tuned model.
- Upload final model to DagsHub storage or Git LFS (requires PAT or LFS enable).

Near-term
- Add SHAP explainability notebook and examples.
- Add unit tests + CI.
- Add FastAPI + Dockerfile for simple deployment.

Optional polish
- Cross-dataset validation and adversarial robustness checks.
- Paper-style `RESULTS.md` with tables/plots and limitations.

How I will work
- I will create small, reviewable commits for each change and run the RF tuning locally here.
- I will not push any credentials or tokens; for DagsHub upload I will wait for a token from you or provide commands to run locally.
